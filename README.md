## Overview

This project implements a market checkout component with a clean, RESTful API. It calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, supports multi-priced discounts, bundling discounts, and receipt generation. User authentication with JWT ensures secure access, and the service is designed for scalability and ease of deployment.
