# Checkout Component 3.0

by [Filip Cyboran](https://github.com/cyboranf)

## Overview

This project implements a market checkout component with a clean, RESTful API. It calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, supports multi-priced discounts, bundling discounts, and receipt generation. User authentication with JWT ensures secure access, and the service is designed for scalability and ease of deployment.

## Running Tests

To run tests in your application, use the following command:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

### Description:
- The `./mvnw` script ensures Maven Wrapper is used, so you donâ€™t need to have Maven installed globally.
- The `-Dspring.profiles.active=test` flag activates the `test` profile, ensuring that the application uses the appropriate configuration (e.g., H2 database).
- All unit, integration, and acceptance tests will be executed, and results will be displayed in the console.

## Building and Running the Application

### Build the Application

To package the application into a JAR file, run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

- `clean`: Removes any previous build artifacts.
- `package`: Packages the application into a JAR file located in the `target` directory (e.g., `target/checkout-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`).

### Run the Application

After building the application, you can run the JAR file with the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/checkout-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that your production `application.properties` file is correctly configured for the database and other necessary services.
- To run the application with specific profiles, use the `--spring.profiles.active` flag. For example:

```bash
java -jar target/checkout-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=production
```
